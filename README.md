# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Tech Stack:
Technology/Frameworks/Libraries Used:
React for building the user interface.
React Router for navigation.

Why This Stack:
Reasons for Choosing Each Technology:

What I Enjoyed:
Interactive Components:

Building interactive components,
Integration of Third-Party APIs:

Working with third-party APIs, especially fake store API, was both exciting . Fetching and displaying real-time data enriched the application's content and functionality.

What I Found Challenging:  
State Management:
Managing state in a React application, especially as it grows in complexity, can be challenging. Deciding on the right state management approach and avoiding unnecessary re-renders is a continual learning process.
